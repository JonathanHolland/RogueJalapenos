#RogueJalapenos - "Too spicy for the law"

Components of MVP left to complete:
 * Add data to the transaction endpoint
 * Add a restful API piece to add transactions for the roundups
 * Complete the configuration modal and persist the value locally (not using a server means this value won't be fully persistent)
 * Complete a piece of logic to use the roundup value and a new example transaction from a TextInput field to use the previously mentioned API to add roundup transactions
